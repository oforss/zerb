## ZeRB - The Zy-El Runeword Browser

A simple graphical helper program for the Diablo II mod Zy-El. It lists all runewords and provides functions for easily filtering and sorting them. 

As I'm sure you've figured out, this is a program with a very specific focus and a very niche audience. Nevertheless it has enjoyed over 2000 total downloads since I started work on it in late 2009 and was well regarded within its target group.

I'm uploading it here only for posterity and easy access to the source code. I have no intentions of continuing work on it, even though there certainly are improvements that could be made, and creases to be ironed out. This was one of my first "real" programs and one that is dear to me, warts and all.

If you want to run ZeRB you have two alternatives:

1. Download the .exe version from where I originally uploaded it on [MediaFire](http://www.mediafire.com/download/jm13bj5klb9o3by/zerb-0.3.2.zip)
2. Run it from source. You will need Ruby, Rubygems and FXRuby (via rubygems). This should work on all common operating systems.
